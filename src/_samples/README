This is a sample collection of some arbitrary content.
This could be anything, and could be used to generate
pages itself, such as if one has company staff, and
each has a page with information about them. Jekyll
can also iterate over collections like this, allowing
the meta data to be used in other pages, such as to
generate a list of said staff.
