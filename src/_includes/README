Headers, footers, and other reusable bits of layout go in here.

This sample site is setup to use `includefm` instead of the jekyll
built-in `include` because in order to use Netlify to edit files,
the files need to be able to support having frontmatter. Netlify
can't write files that don't have it. So, all of the sample includes
have a small frontmatter section with just a `title`, which will be
used by the CMS to show the name of the template.
